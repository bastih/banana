Banana, Cucumber in yellow and python.
======================================

Banana is a tool that is similar to Cucumber(http://cukes.info) but currently
doesn't try to completely implement Ghenkis, as it seems to encourage ascii-art
more than providing something decently readable.

Cucumber is a tool that provides the means to ease writing tests in a human comprehensible
manner in a way that even people that are not proficient in python will be able
to write tests and they are called scenario.

Such a scenario could look like::

    Given I open the about page
    When I click on "contact"
    Expect to see the contact form

A developer on the project will then provide a regex and function so that a test
can actually do something::

    from banana import matches

    @matches(r'Given I open the about page')
    def initialize_page(t):
        t.client = Client()
        t.response = t.client.get('/about/')
        t.failIf(t.response.code != 200)

If developer and scenario-writer are able to constitute a few rules for setting
up those scenarios, it will be easier for people to contribute even if they are
not familiar with python.
