In a perfect world, everyone knows the language your project is written in.
Furthermore, every single one of your users is comfortable writing tests.
So everyone interested in contributing to your project can easily do so without
any barriers.

Unfortunately, the real world rather looks like this:

Someone provides you with a scenario, you provide the test. A multitude of reasons
can be found for that:

  * the contributor is not proficient in python
  * the contributor is not willing to write complicated python tests
  * you want your tests too be human-readable

That's why banana tries to provide tools to allow for such a scenario:

The developer then becomes a translator of those scenarios by providing mappings
to functions that then actually run tests according to its description.
